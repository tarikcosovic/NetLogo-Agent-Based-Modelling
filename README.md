# NetLogo Agent-Based Modelling
NetLogo is a multi-agent programmable modeling environment.

It also allows creating system dynamics model and participatory simulations. 
Netlogo can be used to teach programming, computational thinking, simulation and model building, and understanding of complex phenomena through models in many different domains.

# The Evolution of Religion

We observe the world from the origin of religion, from homo-sapiens to modern man. 
We introduce age, degree of technological development, economy and the state of war as the basic attributes of the world that will scale (non) linearly,
and have a direct impact on the attributes of agents in the current time of the world. Agents will be autonomous, 
and we will observe the spread of existing religions and the introduction of new ones. We will represent members of different religions with colors, 
and propeths and preachers with specific particles. We are interested in changing the coefficient of religious companions through the aging of the world, 
and we ask the following questions:

* Will the oldest religions remain the most popular and dominant?
* Will young religions or emerging ones take over?
* Will agents stop believing in religion as the worldâ€™s technological coefficient rises?
